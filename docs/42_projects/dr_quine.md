## Content

The three folders `ASM`, `C` and `Python` contains the same three programs. Here's what they do:

- `Collen`: During its execution, the program display on the standard output an output identical to the source code of the file used to compile the same program.

- `Grace`: When running, the program writes to a file named Grace Kid the source code of the file used to compile the same program.

- `Sully`: When running the program writes to a file named Sully_X. The X will be a given integer in the source. Once the file is created, the program compiles this file and then runs the new program
