# What about the OCaml pool ?

This pool presents the functional paradigm with the OCaml language. It's in two
weeks and there's 2 rushes. We learn the basics of OCaml, compilation methods,
tail recursion, pattern matching, modules, advances types, variant types,
polymorphic types, functors, etc (not exhaustive).
We also learn the imperative and OOP parts of OCaml.

(description not exhaustive).

- [d00](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day00): basics type and functions.
- [d01](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day01): recursion, tail recursion
- [d02](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day02): pattern matching, records, variants, lists, parametric types, tuples.
- [d03](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day03): compilation, interpreter, link with external libraries, opam, binding to
  C libraries, file types.
- [d04](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day04): Module language.
- [d05](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day05): Imperative parts.
- [d06](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day06): functors.
- [d07](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day07): OOP (1/2)
- [d08](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day08): OOP (2/2)
- [d09](https://github.com/lgiacalo/ocaml/tree/master/day09): Monoids and monads.

We have also two rushes (after d04 and d09) and we manipulate graphics library
such as SDL and GTK.
