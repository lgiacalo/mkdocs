# FdF
[42 School](https://www.42.fr/) project.

## Description

1st project of the Graphic Branch of 42.
FDF is a 42 Project to learn about 3d programming. The program takes a map as parameter and creates its 3d representation.


## Usage
After running `make` to generate the fdf executable you can run the program with `./fdf [valid_fdf_file]`.

A valid fdf file will consist of a matrix of number delimited by spaces. Each number's position represents an (x , y) coordinate with the value of the number itself representing a height (z).

Valid fdf files will always have the same number of elements per row.

Example:
```
$> cat -e 42.fdf
